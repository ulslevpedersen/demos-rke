\title{W3OP: Web Optimized Processor}
\author{Rasmus}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

The W3OP processor is a world wide web optimized soft core processor, that execute the High 5 (HI5) instruction set compiled from JavaScript.

The architecture is centered around a 36-bit instruction set fed by fast dedicated SRAM. The processor itself has a matrix like registry file of 16 rows by 16 columns of 8-byte cells allowing for experimentation both with different processor architectures and (distributed) operating system paradigms.

\section{Instruction Set}
The instruction is 36 bits or 4.5 bytes or 5 {\it nibbles}.

\begin{tikzpicture}
	\draw[step=1cm,gray,thin] (0,0) grid (5,1);
	\node at (0.5,0.75) {4-bit};
	\node at (0.5,0.5) {op};
	\node at (0.5,0.25) {code};
\end{tikzpicture}

The figure above shows a 32-bit immediate being possible with by using the 5th nibble as the opcode. For example it is possible to use.

W3OP is created with the EagleCAD PCB program. There are mechanic spring contacts that allows a for direct contact with the cobber.
